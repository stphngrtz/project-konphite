# Project Konphite
In the scope of this project I want to get some hands-on experience with stuff I'm not familiar with. Typically, you should not add too many unknown technologies to a new project, if you want to have a chance to complete it. This right here is quite the opposite. But hey, I don't have to complete it. The journey is the reward.

To be honest, not everything will be completely new to me, but at least to some degree. Spring Boot, for example. I've spend a good amount of time with Spring Boot 2, but in this project I'm going to add a Spring Boot 3 service. They haven't reinvented the wheel with version 3, of course, but still, some things have changed. You get the idea.

Important note: don't take my architectural decisions serious! This project is not about when to use what technology. I'll come up with silly use-cases, because I want to spend my precious time learning about technology, not giving best-practice advice or implementing a unique business idea.

Oh, speaking of serious decisions, the project name comes from a [name generator](https://mrsharpoblunto.github.io/foswig.js/), it has no special meaning.
